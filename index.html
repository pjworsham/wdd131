            <div class="about grid">
                <p>My name is Pam. I was born in Kansas City, Missouri. I moved with my family to Georgia when I was 18 years old. I am currently working as an Operation Assistance at a local hospital. I love to spend time with my husband and grown children when I have free time. My husband and I also like to travel to Utah to visit my daughter and her husband as often as we can.</p>
